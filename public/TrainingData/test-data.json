If I want to express my feelings more vividly, I could use pictures or emoticons to my friends. I think I usually send emoticons and pictures to my friends while I text messages. Using emoticons is also useful when I have to teach my brother, if he don't know something. I send pictures and videos to make him understand. Second, I don't have to meet people. If I don't have any time, I don't have to waste time to meet people. I also don't have to wear clothes to go outside. Third, I can communicate with many people with text message. If I have to send important information to my friends, I could send message to notice information quickly in short time.

So I talked a lot to my friend, but she texted me as if she was annoyed, so we misunderstood each other and fought. No matter how many emoticons I use, I can't express my feelings like I am actually meeting and talking. The another reason is texting takes a long time. I may not be able to play the keyboard well because my hands are slow, or I may be slow to think about texting carefully because records continue to remain. For instance, when texting online, that is, I should be more careful not to say anything bad to the other person.

Emoji is a typical function in messenger application. Application users can express their emotions with using emoji. In Korea, we call it emoticon. It is a combined word with emotion and icon.

There are a lot of sentences that has a lot of meanings, but we often understand the meaning of the sentence by looking at their gestures or facial expression.

If I handwrote the letter or notes, I can not attach  the videos and pictures that I want to send. In email and text messages are easy and fast to use, too. Actually, I use the text messages and email often. I think can send some videos and pictures is the great advantages of email and text messages. We can send them easy. Another reason that I would rather write emails or text messaging is because I can decorate. I can choose fonts and emoticon. When we use text messaging and email a standard, easy - to - read font that people can understand. I have bad handwriting so people can not always understand my handwriting.

However, I think communicate is the best way to keep it. There are many ways to communicate like talking, calling, or using messenger. These days, many people use messenger for many reasons. Also, I prefer using phone to communicate than talking in person for some reasons.\n\n     First, I can use many emojis and photos. Emojis are the great way to express my feelings. For example, when I feel happy, I can use smiling emojis. Then, my friends can notice my feeling easily. Also, when I watch movie and tell how it is, I can use emojis to tell them. Additionally, photos are good ways to show something. It is the best way to show my situation. I can send picture that I can't explain with talking. Second, using messenger app allows us to send message anywhere. When I make a meet with my friends, I can talk where and when to meet. It makes me to talk when I want too. I can talk anywhere and it makes me can talk any times. It makes me able to send message in night that I can't go outside.

In my opinion, I prefer to use a messenger application like text messaging for several reasons. In this essay, I will tell you about why I prefer to use text messaging.\n\n     First, I can simply communicate with the business. When I talk to my friend, how short I talk, a lot of time goes by. However, text messages can be delivered only to the core, which greatly reduces time. In addition, it is possible to ship in bulk. The same messages, such as notices, photos, and videos can be sent to multiple people at the same time. On the other hand, train tickets and cash receipts can also be issued by text messages. The second is convenience. When we make a voice call, we can not deliver a message unless the call is connected. It happens that you have to make a phone call over and over again. However, if you send a message, the other person will contact you. It is not just when the phone does not work. Text messages are also useful in situations where the other person has to be considerate so that they can think over time and answer. The third is creativity. Text messages require more effort than when talking to friends, because I have to press each button with my fingers to create text. In other worlds, sincerity goes into it.\n\n     Do you prefer talking to friends in person or using a messenger application on a smartphone?

If you like it, which do you prefer, using a messenger application on a smartphone or talking to friends in person? I prefer using a messenger application than talking to friends in person. Let me tell you two reasons why I prefer it.\n\nFirst, covid-19 is severe these days. Therefore, it is safer than meet friends. Even if I don't meet friends, there are many things I can do together to online. Also, you don't need to wear a mask to go outside. Second, I can make friends who live in other countries. If I do it, I can make other friends other than friends I meet at school. Even if they live in another country, you can talk to them at any time if you do it. If you make foreign friends, you can learn about the culture of the country. \n\nLike this, I talked about two reasons why I prefer it. However, I think there are many advantages to meeting and talking to friends in person. For example, compared to messenger applications that do not reveal emotions well, meeting and talking in person is relatively easy to sommunicate, because emotions are very revealed. So when, I fight with my friends, I meet them in person and talk instead of using the messenger application. That's why I originally liked to meet my friends in person and talk. However, as COVID-19 spread, I couldn't go school and I couldn't meet my friend, so I became more used to doing it.","fleschKincaidReading":66.73979069767445,"fleschKincaidGrade":8.223426356589147,"contentGrade":4,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5},{"wordCount":282,"level":7,"numberOfSpellingErrors":4,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":151,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":13,"averageWordLength":4.787234042553192,"averageSentenceLength":20.142857142857142,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":45,"essayContent":"Communication\n\n     In order to live in the world, you have to communicate with people. With the development of the times, the era of online communication rather than face to face communication has unfolded. But I prefer to talk to people directly because i think it's more efficient for people to communicate in person than online.\n\n     First reason is talking face to face is more effective in understanding the other person's mood. you can easily tell whether the person's expression is really funny or whether they are really listening to me. Since you can But easily understand the other person's feelings, you can talk while understanding the other person's feelings so that conflicts do not arise. Second reason is the intimacy with the other party decreases when using messengers. When you get to know your friends on SNS, it is often awkward when you see them in person. However, having a direct conversation from the beginning will help you communicate seamlessly where you are and what you are communicating with. In addition, in SNS, rather than expressing one's feelings, they unconsciously keep smiling, so it is impossivble to know the other person's personality and communication is not carried out smoothly because there is a little pretentious aspect. \n\nIt is of course good to communicate on SNS, but there is also a cautious side as cyber crimes occur a lot. Also, although it is not my intention, the other person may feel offended, and I think that it is easier to resolve conflicts because they can be heard from their tone of voice or facial expressions if they see a part and talk about it.

Some people prefer to talk online and others like to talk offline. They have own advantage and disadvantage. However, I prefer to talk online instead of talking offline for two reasons.\n\n  First, talking on online is very comfortable. It can be used any time or any place. Also at offline, it is hard to meet at midnight, but on online you can chatting with your friends until midnight. And it is useful in various situations. Such as emergency situations. So l use online chatting for this convienient.\n  Second, it has many substantial resources. For example, Kakaotalk has cute and characteristic emoticons. In real life, there are no emoticons to use, so sometimes, it is hard to express my feelings. Even though emoticons are not free, people many use cute emoticons because it is easy and fun to express my feelings. On the other hand, online chatting has powerful advantage. Everyone has a person who you really hate, didn't like, or do not want to talk and meet in person. In real life, you  can't say \"I don't want to talk with you.\" because people may think your behave is rude. But on online, you can block the person and erase his number and chatting room. It helps you to prevent worse situations.\n\n  For these reasons, I prefer to talk online instead of offline. In addition, in the era of COVID-19, it is safer and more comfortable to talk online than to meet and talk.","fleschKincaidReading":66.38524509803923,"fleschKincaidGrade":7.519313725490196,"contentGrade":4,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5},{"wordCount":252,"level":7,"numberOfSpellingErrors":11,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":120,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":12,"averageWordLength":4.801587301587301,"averageSentenceLength":10.5,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":34,"essayContent":"                                                                Communication\n\n     Nowadays, many people communicate through massenger. Someone likes talking in person, but I prefer to use massengers to communicate with my friends and family. In the past, Every people are talking with friends or family in person but we can use many applications to communicate with people today so I think we don`t have to talk in person.\n\n     There are some reasons that massenger is better than talking with. First, I think massenger is comfortable. People can think masseges don`t have emotion but you can send emoticons to express your feeling well. In addition, Massenger can send pictures. You can share your picture or video with your friends. \n Senond, I can send messages anywhere and anytime. If you have to ask some homeworks to your friends, you just send massage. How comfortable! Also, Talking with your freinds is limitative but messenger is not. \n Third, you can messages with foriegners. You can make friends with massengers. You maybe text with some celebrities. \nLast, you can give some gifts through messenger. It is kind of coupon and you can order what you had given. I think this function is useful when someone`s birthday. Also, you can chat with robot. I use this function to know my baseball team`s news or today`s highlight.\n\n     There are many convinient functions to use massenger. You can use many benefcial and convenient functions. Also talking in person have many good things but I prefer to use massenger to communicate with people because it`s convenient as well as easy.","fleschKincaidReading":59.57153458498024,"fleschKincaidGrade":8.092907114624506,"contentGrade":3,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":2}]
