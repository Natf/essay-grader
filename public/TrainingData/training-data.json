Last year, i played one game called Red Dead Redemption2. It this game, specifically in chapter 6, the main character and his friend started to help native americans. Even it wasn't the main point of the story, it made me to be interested in native american culture. I tried to learn their culture and languages in internet, but it was not enough and it wasn't fun. So, if I go there, I really want to learn their culture, including their languages. Also, I want to go there becuase I would be able to experience untouched nature. \n\n  Second, I want to be in many different festivals. One if it is pride parade in San Fransisco.

It is the country that I always want to visit, and there are lots of things that I can enjoy.\n\n       What made me think I want to visit Italy is its history. I recently had a final exam, and I studied history a lot. I learned about western Europe history. I was interested at the Vatican city, because it is the smallest city in the world. During studying western Europe history, I learned more about Vatican city. I thought that I want to visit some day. Another reason that I want to travel to Italy is its famous food. I guess everyone knows, Italy is famous for its pizza and pasta. I'm not a big fan of pasta and pizza, but I heard that Italy's are different, and they taste amazing. I want to go Italy and enjoy its original pizza, and pasta. Maybe, Italian pizza and pasta can make me like them. The final reason that I want to travel to Italy is its old buildings and ruins.

I want to experience many local foods and visit famous places like Colosseum. I've searched about Italy, and known that Italy is located on Europe. The weather is temperate among all four seasons. I found it interesting that the shape of Italy is like a boot because our country, Korea also has a unique shape.\n\n    I've traveled a lot in my country, but I've only traveled twice, Australia and Vietnam on abroad. Among those two countries the better one was to Vietnam. Maybe I enjoyed Vietnam more because its only been a year since I went to Vietnam, so the excitement may be still in my mind. When I've been to Australia, I was eleven years old, so even though I was learning English at that time, it was hard for me to understand native's talking and it was hard to communicate. It was even the first time to go to English speaking country too. Also, it wasn't that satisfing because I've gone there with a group tour. It was hard to follow the schedule and it wasn't that comfortable because there was people who I don't know too. I was some of satisfied too because I've been there for one week, so I could do many things. I was a little upset when I traveled to Vietnam because I've been there for only four days. It was too short to experience many things. I enjoyed Vietnam because there was swimming pool where I've been during the travel and it was really relaxing. I think the style of traveling was more to me on Vietnam.\n\n     To conclude, I've been to two countries, Australia and Vietnam. I enjoyed the travel to Vietnam more.

While we're traveling abroad, we can visit many famous places, have diverse experience, and learn about the culture of the country that we are in. Therefore, I like going abroad so much. However, these days, we can't go on a trip because of corona virus. Nevertheless, if I could travel to any country in the world, I would visit the United Kingdom. \n\n     The first reason is that England is one of the most famous countries in the world. I think almost all the people know it. England is the country that English is originated from. Before corona virus, the number of tourist in the United Kingdom was about 36 millions. Also we're able to encounter England in literature. For example, it's the background of the famous mystery novel 'Sherlock Homes'. Besides, a lot of famous literary works are from England. 'Romeo and Juliet', 'Jane Eyre', 'Wuthering Heights', 'The Merchant of Venice' are the examples.\n     Secondly, the United Kingdom is so beautiful country. It has many splendid landmarks. Some popular landmarks are Big Ben, Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, and the British Museum. Big Ben is the landmark that represent England. In fact, the bell in the clock tower is Big Ben, but the clock tower itself is often called Big Ben, too. Tower Bridge is a bascule bridge with huge Gothic towers on both sides. Buckingham Palace is the home of Queen Elizabeth. Lastly, the British Museum is called the best museum where we can see everything in the world. I want to see all these beautiful landmarks in person.\n\n     If I could travel to any country in the world, I'd like to visit England. I want to visit there because it is really famous and so beautiful. Before Corona, my family planned to go on a trip to the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, that trip was suddenly cancelled because of corona virus. For the same reason, we can't travel abroad now either. I hope this situation to get better as soon as possible and I could travel to England."},{"wordCount":259,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":132,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":15,"averageWordLength":4.324324324324325,"averageSentenceLength":9.592592592592593,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":16,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                              Places\n\n     There are a lot of countries in the world. All countries have each individuals. I like all the countries, but my favorite country is Guam. If I could travel to any country in the world, I will choose Guam without hesitation.\n\n     Firstly, Guam is suitable to relax. Guam's climate is warm enough to do a lot of activities and relax. I have traveled 5 countries, Guam is the best place to relax. The others are too hot to relax. For example, when I visit to China, it was too hot to walk around. There were too many people, so I couldn't see anything. Moreover, it was too noisy, so I couldn't sleep and relax. Even though, Guam is not very hot and noisy. \n     Secondly, there are many fascinating things in Guam. I do a lot of captivating things, like scuba diving, surfing, canoeing, boating. It was really thrilling and impressive experiments. Also, I visit to Guam's land mark, 'Cliff of Love'. There was an interesting story with the landmark. Also, I took a picture with the rainbow. It was the best picture I have ever taken. Moreover, my family did 'Locks of Love'. If somebody write their wish on the 'Locks of Love', the wish comes true. We wished that our family to be happy forever. It was really touching memory.\n\n     I think that Guam would be my favorite place forever. I like Guam because of many interesting things.

The attractions and the natural environment of Canada are really fascinating. There are two impressive places that I'd like to visit in Canada, which are the major reasons that I want to travel there.\n\n The first place is Canada's capital, Ottawa. It is the second-big city in Canada. The Rideau Canal is one of the popular attractions in the city. You can take a walk by it, and in winter, the frozen canal's scenery is amazing. Parliament of Canada is also one of the attractions. Centennial Flame is really fascinating. The library of Parliament is literally wonderful and is the place where I admire the most. The scenery that can be seen from the Peace tower is also impressive.\n The next place is Niagara Falls, where more than 12million tourists visit every year. It is located at the boundary of two countries, Canada and the US. This giant falls is well developed as a tourist spot. There, you can go aboard a cruise and watch the beautiful scenery. For a certain period, you can also enjoy the fireworks of Niagara Falls. There are caves where the falls can be seen behind it. The grand view of a great quantity of water falling is the factor for its numerous tourists.\n\nIn short, the two places that I'd like to visit are Ottawa and Niagara Falls.

I agree that it is crucial to possess many valuable things in our lives because they will make us more happy, and we can also help others with those valuable things.\n\n  First, my valuable things will make me more happy. For example, if I have a lot of money, and can buy everything that I want, I would be free from many worries which came from money.

Also, if I have many good relationships like friends, I would be able to tell my worries to my friends, and would be mentally healthier, which will make me feel happy.\n  Second, I would be able to help other people with my valuable things.

As I mentioned before, each person feels delighted in different things but all people like to have the things they value. If we own objects that we value, we will be delighted even to think that we own them. Also, we will feel joyful while we are using them. For example, if someone thinks money is valuable, that person would be joyful to have it. While he is using the money for particular purpose such as buying and donating, he would be pleasant, too.\n     Secondly, mentally valuable things are what make who we are. Some example of mentally valuable things are experience, memories, and good mind. We live based on these. These are things which we can't buy with anything and we can't give to or receive from anyone. These are our own things that we only have. Therefore, these show our own personalities and characteristics. Maybe that's why sometimes mental things are considered more important than physical things.\n\n     I believe it is crucial to possess many valuable things. I think like that because materially valuable things give us joy and mentally valuable things are what make who we are. I also trust that if we own materially valuable things and mentally valuable things harmoniously, we could get the real happiness. I hope I could possess many things that I value and be a happy person."},{"wordCount":266,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":120,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":14,"averageWordLength":4.398496240601504,"averageSentenceLength":14,"maximumWordLength":12,"maximumSentenceLength":24,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":3,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                                  Objects\n\n     In life, we have a valuable thing by one and one. Some people say that it isn't important to have a lot of valuable things, but others don't. In these days, however, having valuable things is beneficial because our modern society is so competitive. For this reason, I agree with the statement.\n\n     Firstly, it would become insurance for the future. Valuable things are mostly expensive, so it would be good insurance in the future. Like gold, diamonds, and others, they would become great insurance when your old. When you do retirement, you don't have money, so valuable things would make your life can be same like before you quit your job. For example, if you don't have money, but you have a lot of precious things, you can make money for those. \n     Secondly, your quality of life would be improved by valuable things. When you have a lot of valuable things, you would be pleased. Also, they would make your life better. People admired someone who have a lot of money or have many valuable things. People couldn't neglect you because you have valuable things. For instance, many people behave kind or careful to who have many valuable things, then your life would be improved.\n\n     These are two reasons why I think that it is crucial to possess many valuable things. I know that we would be little nervous when we have too many things to lose. Also, there are a lot of things that we can't put a price on. However, I think that there is no disadvantage when you have many valuable things."},{"wordCount":250,"level":8,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":94,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":19,"averageWordLength":4.668,"averageSentenceLength":12.55,"maximumWordLength":10,"maximumSentenceLength":22,"contentGrade":4,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                           Valuable Things\n\n     People always want to get more valuable things.

If we have many valuable things, we might not worry about money problem. We can sell the valuable things we have if we need money. Then, we might not worry and sell the things that we have. \n     Secondly, we might be happier. The standard of valuable things is different.

Some are born in a rich family, while most of the others don't. Many storybooks describe riches as unhappy people, to give children morals that things like love and friendship is the most crucial thing. Those things are indeed important, but my opinion is that money is important than those. Having valuable things is far more critical than the abstract concepts. \n\n First reason is that valuable things allow us to live easier. So, as you can see, many people are working for it. And those who can't eventually end up in a difficult situation. The valuable things are essential. We buy food to eat, house to sleep, clothes to wear, and they are needed to go to certain schools. If we are not rich enough, we'll have to dedicate parts of our lives to earn it. With money, we can use those time to more meaningful things, like spending time with families, or developing ourselves.\n Next reason is 'happiness'. It is the thing that many people want and seek in their lives. And I think we can be happy with money. When we do things we like, we feel happy. It can be dressing up in nice cloths, or helping people in need. People can easily get the chance to do all of these things with money. Money also enhances the quality of our lives; we can wear expensive cloths, eat delicious food, and more. It can enhance the quality of our lives in different ways, like achieving ideals that we seek.\n\nTo sum up, because valuable things can allow our lives to be quite easier and make us happy, they are crucial in our lives. There are many benefits of them. I'd like to say that they are essential. And everybody knows that. It is virtually proven. All the people are working for money. They are spending their time for it.

However, I would rather attend a school and take classes in person than getting educatoin in online.\n\n  First, online classes are harder to concentrate. There are too many things that distract me from studying. For example, I should take care of the camera. If I put in camera in wrong place, than it might just show others cilling or floor. Also, if I am in home, there many things that I can play with, such as, I can play with my phone or computer. Therefore, it is hard for me to concentrate in classes when I am taking online classes.\n\n  Second, it is hard to develop the social skills. In online classes, very few students barely speak. Which means that there are not much communication between teacher and students, and students and students. To be specific, because we are talking over the device, it is hard for us to communicate and bond the relationships. Also, because we are not together except the class time, so students would not fight, play, or communicate together, and it would make them hard to develop their social skills.\n\n  For these reasons : online classes are harder to concentrate, and it make students to develop their social skills, I would rather attend a school and take classes in person than taking an online classes in home.

First, students can't easily focus on classes. In students' homes, There are many things that can interrupt their concentration. Therefore, students can't focus in studies and often do something else. Second, school is not only place to study, but also a place where students develop social skills. While living at school with their friends, they develop social skills and learn various things. But during online classes, students can't meet in person with their friends at school. Also, if they can't meet their friends, some students may lose their interests in studying. However, on the contrary, classes at school allow students to interact with each other and influence each other. Also, offline classes make it easier for teachers to teach and manage students and improve the quality of instruction. For example, physical education classes offer variety of activities, however  it is limited to being held in home.\n\n     Offline classes and online classes have different advantages and disadvantages.

Students can't go to school normally, too. Therefore, they take online classes. Online class is the class that we do on the internet, not in person. Online classes have some advantages, but have many disadvantages, too. I prefer attending school and taking classes in person to being homeschooled using online programs for two reasons.\n\n     Firstly, we can meet friends and teachers in person. We can easily communicate with them, and have more fun classes. While we are taking online class, we are not able to talk and play with our friends easily, but we can have time with them on the break time. Also, our teachers are able to see what we are doing and give feedback to us more simply. By communicating with them, we can also learn social relationship. \n     The second reason is that we can be provided the good educational environment. On the offline class, teachers and students are all looking at each other so it is difficult to do other things during the class. However, during online class, it is different. We can see others only in the screen so that other can see only limited part. Therefore, it is not difficult to do something else and some of the students do. In fact, there are students who play games during the class. I know it because sometimes they speak to their team members with their microphone on. This is one of the serious problems of online class.\n\n     I prefer offline class than offline class because we can meet friends and teachers in person and we can be provided the good educational environment. Nowadays, there is a huge gapes between students who are good at studying and students who fail to study well. Also, students have less opportunity to meet their friends and teachers.

Some students miss the class which attend school and take classes in person, but others don't. In my opinion, I prefer to take classes in person.\n\n     Firstly, students can develop sociality. In school, students can debate and learn how to say logically but not to offend others during classes. Also, they talk with their friends in break time. They can learn talking skills while talking to friends. For example, some people make it difficult to take people in person because many people talk with messengers. It means that some people's sociality is decreasing. For these reason, students should take classes in school and develop their sociality. \n     Secondly, school has educational environment. In their houses, they are not better place than school. Students recognize that school is a place studying. However, in their houses, they usually take rest, so they are not suitable to study. For example, these days, many students study in their houses and the level of students' knowledge is decreasing. Text scores have been getting low since coronavirus happened. Also, it is hard to understand when I take classes online. It is hard to question something that I don't know, also I can't communicate with my friends and teachers.\n\n     These are the two reasons why I like to study in school in person.

Then, if they are older, they might don't now how to become intimate with others because they haven't make their friends by themselves.\n     Secondly, if students go to school, they might learn how to adapt to new environment. Every year, the class changes, and students meet new friends and new classrooms. Then, they should adapt to the new environment. However, if students do homeschooling, they might meet same teacher ever day, and they might study in same environment every day. Thus, they might don't know how to spend time well with others in new environment.\n\n     For students, environment will be so important.

When we did online class, we didn't go to school, so students think it is boring, so they want to do another things when teacher teach them in online class, but teachers can't know what students are doing. For example, in our class, one student did game when teacher is teaching students in online class.. It is hard to    test students in online class, so students can't know their grade and didn't concentrate to class. \n     Second, students health can be bad. We did online class, so we did it with our smart phone or computer. We usually did online class for 6 hours and 7 hours. We saw our computer screen for 6 and 7 hours, so our eyesight can be bad. For example, my friend who did online class for a year, her eyesight is bad now. She have to wear glasses now. There are many students' eyesight become bad.Also, our back and shoulders, and we can be turtle neck, but when we go to school, we can do P.E. class, and walk to school, it can be exercise, and we eat healthy lunch in school, so our health can be better. \n\n     For these two reasons, I think go to school is better then do online class.

Well, I think the place and the environment of it are. To give an example of studying environment, there is home schooling, which allows you study at home and there is also studying at school, which you'll have to study offline with teachers. These two have their own benefits and also some disadvantages, and I favor the second option. I have some reasons for that.\n\nFirstly, I think the place 'school' enables you to study better. School is where its purpose is to teach students things. Teachers in schools are much more professional. They teach us better than online classes. I also don't think house is a proper place to study, since there are many diversions in houses, such as televisions, video games, and more. These distract us. Moreover, unlike people in schools, the people in our home are not always studying, or teaching things, which means that there are noises that disrupt studying.\n Secondly, there are many students in schools. I think they are important for enthusiastic studying. The students can be friends, and it can make going to school and studying interesting. It is because anything, even studying, is fun when it's done with friends. Also, the students motivate each other to study. They can study hard to get better grades than their friends, and they can help each other when they have difficulty understanding something. The students can also encourage each other, like when friends get low grades, or have low confidence on studying.\n\nIn short, the two ideas, that schools are good places to study, and that students can help each other's studying is the reasons that I think studying in school is better than being schooled at home. Some people may disagree to my second opinion and insist that some students don't give helps, but in that case, I think other students can help those students to be interested in school. I believe that school is the best place to study, and to get or give help."},{"wordCount":327,"level":8,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":131,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":17,"averageWordLength":4.495412844036697,"averageSentenceLength":19.235294117647058,"maximumWordLength":10,"maximumSentenceLength":37,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"Computers\n\n    In my previous English academy, we used tablets during the class. We used E-Books and we made PPT and do many projects with it. I really loved going there and learn new things with tablets. Everyone paid attention to class, and many parents, students, and teachers prefer that style of teaching. I agree that students should be allowed to use computers during lessons, because students will more focus in class, and computers will allow students to do many things.\n\n  First, if the computers are allowed to be used in lessons, students would be able to focus better in class. Students would be able to search anything they want during the class. For example, if there is the word that I can't understand during the class, I can search it with my computer. However, if I should search that word after the class, it means that I wasn't able to understand the class during that time. Or maybe I might forget the word that I wanted to search and don't find out what the word means even after the class.\n\n  Second, computers will allow students to do many during the class. For example, students can write essays during the class. As teacher would walk around and evaluate each student's work, it would help students to improve both their typing skills which would help them in long terms, and writing skills. Also, students would be able to do some group projects during the class. Which means that students could finish their work during the class and don't have to meet each other after school.\n\n     Therefore, I think students should be allowed to use computers during lessons, because students will be able to focus better in class, and computers will allow students to do many things in class which wasn't able before. Some may say that student may play some game in the classroom, but if the student is going to play the game, they will play it anyway."},{"wordCount":257,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":114,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":15,"averageWordLength":5.136186770428016,"averageSentenceLength":12.85,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":22,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                               Should students be allowed to use computers during classes?\n\n In the information age, almost all people use computers. Therefore, some people argue that students should be allowed to use computers during lessons. They claim that it is more effective to obtain information, so using computers during classes is necessary. On the other hand, others insist that students shouldn't be allowed to use computers because students can't easily focus on classes. In my opinion, students shouldn't be allowed to use computers during lessons.\n\n     The first reason why I think students shouldn't be allowed to use computer is that not every student have their own computer. When students use computers, they can easily search for information using internet. However, students who don't have their own computers can be at a disadvantage. As a result, there are students who do not have their computers, so using computers during classes is unfair. The second reason is using computers can disrupt other students to focus on classes. For example, sometimes in classes, the students phone rings and interrupts the progress of lessons. That's why teachers tell us to turn off our smartphones in class. The one reason that students shouldn't allowed to use computer is similar with this. The computers can disrupt students' concentration.\n\n     In summary, students shouldn't be allowed to use computers during classes. First, it is unfair to some students who don't have their computers. Second, it can disrupt student's concentration. Of course, using computers during class can be helpful. However, if convenience causes discomfort, it is no longer convenient."},{"wordCount":257,"level":8,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":114,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":13,"averageWordLength":3.992217898832685,"averageSentenceLength":14.277777777777779,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":28,"contentGrade":4,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":3,"vocabularyGrade":3,"conventionsGrade":4,"essayContent":"                                                                                Computers\n\n     I think all students like to do computer. Also, it is so useful so we use many times. So, to student it is really good device because it gives us happiness and easy to do assignment. But I think we have to use computers just our break time. Actually, we already use many times to do computer and if we use more it can cause many problem. So now I'ii tell you why it is better to not using during class.\n\n\n     First, it can causes health problem. I think most of students know that if we use computer too much time, we can have eye problem and tech neck so on. I mean it is already a lot that we using computer so we don't have to spend more time even using class time. For example, one student using computer a lot so he has to wear glasses.\n     Second, it disturbs student's study. Computer has so many things that we like, so we can easily entice. So, I mean if we use computer in break time it doesn't matter. but if we use computer it can be a big problem. Our score will be lower and also we can;t communicate with teachers.\n\n     I think it is also good to use computer but without class time with two reasons that it can cause health problem and it can disturb our study. I hope students regulate their schedule well and they don't have to make other problem. I think regulate their time and using less is most important."},{"wordCount":350,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":152,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":22,"averageWordLength":5,"averageSentenceLength":15.217391304347826,"maximumWordLength":15,"maximumSentenceLength":30,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                         Computer, Which Is Bad for Studying\n\n     Nowadays, people use the computer for various purpose. They use it for doing their work, taking online class, playing entertainment, and other things. Computers are useful and make our life better. However, there's a saying that students should use computers while they're taking the class. Using computers during the class will have many benefits but also many drawbacks. I think that students shouldn't be allowed to use computers during the lessons.\n\n     The first reason is that using computers is not good for students' health. Students use a lot of electronic devices such as smartphones and computers these days. These electronic devices emit electromagnetic waves which are waves transmitted as electric and magnetic fields change periodically in space and they affect humans' health negatively. The electronic waves make our body tired and they can also cause cancer. In addition to this, electronic devices can make our eyesight bad and cause other health problems. \n     Secondly, computer distract students. Students should concentrate on the lesson, but if they can use computer while they're taking the lesson, there can be the environment for the students to do something else. They might play game, search the thing which is not related to the class, or do others. My homeroom teacher gathers our smartphone before the class. Smartphones have many similarities with the computers., so my teacher might do that to prevent the students from being distracted. The students are allowed to use the computer to do well in class, but this make the situation worse. \n\n     I believe that students shouldn't be allowed to use the computer during the lesson. I think like this because using computers is not good for students' health and it distract students. Some people might say that students should be allowed to use the computer during the lesson because it will be helpful. However, although computers are good for other things, it is not optimal to use computer in the class because it can keep students from doing well contrary to the intention. Therefore, students should not be allowed to use computer during the lesson."},{"wordCount":251,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":123,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":12,"averageWordLength":5.155378486055777,"averageSentenceLength":13.210526315789474,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":21,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                            Computers\n\n     Recent days, many people listen their classes by using their computers. However, some people disagree with the idea that it is beneficial to students to use computers during classes. In my opinion, I agree that students should be allowed to use computers during lessons. \n\n     First, it is great opportunity to take various ways of teaching. Recent days, many schools use computers during school classes. They try many types of classes and they locate best type of classes which can make students to understand more. For example, our schools do various classes by using computers. My school do investigation, quiz, and other things by using computers during classes. They help to understand class better. \n     Second, it would helpful to students to concentrate classes. It is boring when students just take classes. Only listening concepts and answering questions isn't interesting and fun for students. However, when students do creative activities related classes by using computers, they will concentrate more. For instance, my classmates usually pay attention more when they do activities even though it is related to class. For this situation, using computers is is more efficient to students concentrate more, because computers allowed to do many creative things. \n\n     These are the two reasons why I agree with the statement. I also understand the point that it can cause computer addiction. However, it can modulate easily because students use computers during classes when they are with their teachers. Their teachers can control that point, so we don't have to worry about that."},{"wordCount":289,"level":8,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":139,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":12,"averageWordLength":5.010380622837371,"averageSentenceLength":13.136363636363637,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":28,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                Using Computers During Lessons\n\n     Computers are doing really important role in our lives. These days, some teachers allow to use computers during class, because it can help the teachers. Many people think that it is good idea. On the other hand, some think that teachers can teach their students well without computers. Like them, I also believe that students shouldn't use their computers during lessons.\n\n     Firstly, I think that students might not concentrate on class. Even though they use their computers for education, they might want to do other things. Students' concentration is mostly much lower than adults, so their concentration can be easily interrupted. If students are studying on a computer and see that there are games and chatting application in computer, they will play the game because of their bad concentration. Then, they won't listen at teacher explaining things that students should know. \n     Secondly, computers can affect students' health badly. If people use computers a lot, their health can be affected. People can hurt their neck and their eyes can be worse if they do computers more than two hours per day. Classes are much more than two hours. They are usually 6 hours and sometimes, 7 hours. Then, students might be sick. For example, because of online class, my neck got hurt a lot. After using the computers for a long time because of online class, my neck was ache. Even if students use their computers for educational purposes, health problems cannot be prevented.\n\n     I think that teachers shouldn't allow their students to use their computers during class because students might not concentrate on class, and they can affect students' health. Sometimes, computers can have advantages. However, I believe that computers should be use for entertainment, not education."},{"wordCount":256,"level":8,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":115,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":21,"averageWordLength":4.66796875,"averageSentenceLength":14.222222222222221,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":34,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":3,"essayContent":"                                                          Using Computers During Lesson\n\n    These days, students did online class, so we use computer in lesson. When we in school, we didn't use our computer. I think it is not good idea that students use computer during lesson, because students can't concentrate to lesson and they use too much computer. \n\n     First, students can't concentrate duirng lesson. When they use their computer during lesson, they can do other things with computer. For example, like playing game, surfing internet, and watching SNS. I think computer distrupt their study. Computer also spends much time than not using computer. When we usingg computer, we have to turn on the computer, and click application also have to charge computer, but not using computer, we just have to open the book and grab the pencil. \n     Second, students use too much computer. Nowadays, students use computer lots of times. For example, they use to play games, listening music, doing homework, but when we use it in lesson too, students health could be bad, ad they can be computer addicts. They can get bad eyesite, and bad waist. Using computer in lesson, it is harmful to students.\n\n     For these two reasons, I think students shouldn't use computer during lesson. In our school, students didn't use computer during lesson, I want to use computer in lesson sometimes. Using computer during lesson also have advantages like we can find the words. or we can type content of lesson, but I think there is more disadvantages, it is why I think using computer in lesson is bad."},{"wordCount":346,"level":9,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":164,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":4.817919075144508,"averageSentenceLength":18.36842105263158,"maximumWordLength":15,"maximumSentenceLength":36,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"Computers in Classes\n\nIn our digital world, computers and smartphones have now become something essential and natural things in out lives. Also, because of covid-19, the potential of the online classes, or classes using computers was shown to the world. Although there were indeed some problems, I believe teachers and students both can get a benefit from these digital classes. There are several reasons why, and I'll give you two reasons.\n\nFirstly, using computers in classes will help both the students and the teachers. For the students, they'll be able to get information easily with the search functionalities, especially when they don't know something like vocabularies and mathematical formulas. Also, teachers will get help from the computers, since the teachers won't have to do bothering things such as giving out class materials when computers will do it instead, by showing the data on computer screens. Also, students will be able to take exams or submit assignments through computers, and maybe it will lessen the amount of work that teachers have to check.\n\nNext, it will also allow students to become familiar with using computers. If students really use computers in classes, it means that they will use computers for a long time and really frequently. It will give enough time for the students to get use to it. They will be able to type out sentences fast, and will learn how to control the computers. And, the skills earned from the classes, such as employing the apps usefully, will be definitely beneficial when they grow up and get their jobs. Especially since I believe there will be more jobs related to computer and digital works in the future.\n\nIn short, I think using computers during classes will help students and teachers in many ways, and students will learn many skills of using the computers. Most people in the opposing position will say that computers will only be distractions. But my idea is different. I bet teachers will be able to monitor what the students are doing in classes. I hope students will someday be allowed to use computers in classes."}]

Those inventions are making our lives much more comfortable. For example, smartphones allow us to easily communicate with other people. Cars allow us to go to another place. Among many useful inventions, I believe refrigerator has contributed the most to society because it allows us to store food freshly for long time and there are many kinds of refrigerators. \n\n     First, it allows us to store food freshly for long time. Without refrigerator, foods would rot easily. Food easily get rotten when the weather is hot. If we eat rotten food, we might get many diseases. Especially in summer, foods go bad easily. Thanks to the refrigerator, we can eat fresh food even in summer. We can store food for a long time. When the food is left, we store it in refrigerator. However, if there were no refrigerator, we would have to throw away it. Also, in the past, cool water was very scarce. As a result, only rich people could eat ice or cool water. However, we can drink cool water whenever we want because of the refrigerator. Most people cannot imagine a life without refrigerator. \n     Additionally, there are many kinds of refrigerator. We can choose the refrigerator that fits to our purpose. Nowadays, people use refrigerator to not only store food but also store other things like cosmetics. As a result, many kinds of refrigerators have developed for various purposes. We can store foods or things at a perfect temperature. We can eat foods more freshly and deliciously because there are many kinds of refrigerators and we can use one that can store foods well. For example, there is a Kimchi refrigerator which can store Kimchi better than other refrigerators. Also, there is a cosmetic refrigerator which we can put cosmetics inside. \n\n     For these reasons, I strongly believe refrigerator has contributed the most to society. Almost everyone has refrigerators. We can store food freshly for a long period. Also, there are many kinds of refrigerator so that we can choose one for our purpose. Refrigerator has changed our lives and affected out lives significantly."},{"wordCount":354,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":162,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":21,"averageWordLength":4.940677966101695,"averageSentenceLength":14.16,"maximumWordLength":12,"maximumSentenceLength":41,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                               Greatest Invention\n     During human's development, there have been a lot of inventions. Invention means creating new things or improve things that existed. Invention is necessary for development of people's lives. All the things around us are inventions. Some inventions, like electricity or cars are considered as the examples of greatest inventions. Among them, I think the greatest invention is the computer. Computer enabled us to do a lot of things with themselves.\n\n     For the purpose of the invention of the computer was much faster information processing and transmission. As it develops, technology also developed a lot and computers became common. Also, smartphones that we use these days are based on computers. They are necessary for our lives. Computers help human to share information each other easily, and to search various information. Also, most things during our lives can be done by computers. Therefore, I think the invention of the computer is the most significant invention.\n     Also, my idea for future invention is a thunder generator. It would be able to change a lot of thunder to larger amount of electric energy. People could not use thunder to produce electric energy because thunder is too powerful to absorb its energy and transform to electric power that human uses. However, in the future, there will be a lot of developments of technology, and maybe people will be able to control and absorb the energy of thunder. For the detail of my invention, there should be lightning rod on the very top of the generator, and some useful machine that is made of material that withstands the power of thunder will change powerful thunder to usable electric energy. It will provide enough amount of energy to all cities in a country. \n\n     I also think that Edison invented a lot of helpful inventions. However, I believe today's development could not be achieved without the invention of the computer. There are a lot of things which are based on computers. Things such as smartphones and artificial intelligent are basically base on computers. Therefore, for conclusion, I want to argue that the computer is one of the most greatest inventions."},{"wordCount":354,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":180,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":5.1525423728813555,"averageSentenceLength":12.206896551724139,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":20,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                            Inventions\n\n     Many great inventions changed our lives and make them more comfortable. Smartphones, computers, cars, and washing machines are one kind of innovative inventions. In my opinion, I think electricity is one of the most helpful invention that has been incredibly improved our lives. It is because our lives are based on electricity. Also, electricity can help us in the future too.\n\n     To begin with, the things that we use these days are all put basis on electricity. It has no doubt that electricity contributed to our society and form modern civilization. Lights, phones, televisions, and computers all need electricity to operate. Entire everyday life are related with electricity. In addition, electricity promote active economy. The products that we use are produced in factories by using electricity. Not only in the manufacturing process, but we also use electricity while pack and circulate the products. Also, electricity helps us to communicate without the limitation of time and place. We can access to the internet easily thanks to electricity. We aren't able to develop our technology this much without electricity.\n     The second reason is that electricity can be beneficial in the future. Today, the most serious concern of people is environment problem. And air pollution is one kind of big environment problem. The main cause of air pollution is a vehicle that discharges exhaust fumes. However, electricity can help remove the problem. Electric cars don't emit carbon dioxide, so they don't make any air pollution. If electric cars become more commercialized and widely used, environment problem will drastically decrease. Furthermore, electricity can be alternative energy in the future. Fossil fuel is our energy source these days, but it is not enough and it has negative affect to environment. When technology is developed in future, electricity can be an eco-friendly energy source. \n\n     For these reasons, I believe that electricity is one of the most advantageous invention that makes our life comfortable. Everything in our lives is associated with electricity. It can also solve our concern and be helpful resource in future. I can't imagine the world without electricity because it is widely used and makes better lives."},{"wordCount":352,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":153,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":4.480113636363637,"averageSentenceLength":13.538461538461538,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":23,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                        Inventions\n\n     No one can imagine living without smartphones these days. Almost every people think that smartphones are the most useful inventions in our lives. However, in my opinion, I think paper is the invention that has been incredibly helpful and improved our lives. I think this way because it is one of the mos important objects in human's history, and it is necessary for us.\n\n\n     To begin with, paper is one of the most important objects in human's history. It was firstly invented in ancient china. It was invented by Chae Ryun, from chinese han dynasty. Before then, people used papyrus. However it was destroyed easily, so it couldn't be preserved for long time. After the invention of paper, human could write and record historical events with paper, so we can now learn history. I think without paper, the invention of smartphone could have been hard. Also, it is important economically. Since cashes are made from paper, we need paper. \n     Second, paper is necessary for us. Many people think that smartphones or displays can replace paper in the near future. However, we can't ignore papers because we still do lots of things with paper. Students take their exam or read text books made from paper. Also, many businessmen or workers from lots of countries use paper when they work. Maybe digital things can be more convenient, but living without paper is impossible now. I think papers should be more eco-friendly so that we can use it forever. However, we need to cut down lots of trees to make paper, so some people don't think paper to be the best invention. But I think we can't ignore the fact that people need paper, and paper is important part of our history. \n\n     To sum up, paper is the most important and useful invention in our lives. It is served as an important part of our history, and we still need it to do many things. I think smartphone is also an important invention, but the most important thing in our life is paper that is near us now. I think we shouldn't undersestimate paper."},{"wordCount":351,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":160,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":4.452991452991453,"averageSentenceLength":12.10344827586207,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":25,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                         Which of The Inventions Contributed to Our Society?\n\n     Recently, many people believe smartphones as a great invention. I think smartphones are the most significant invention that we use often. Including smartphones, there are many useful inventions that contributed to society. On the other hand, In my opinion, I think that car is one invention that has contributed the most to society. \n\n     First of all, we are much more convenient with cars. I think this because cars are the most efficient way to get to destination. There are some other transportation like airplanes, but we do not use airplanes to go to school or company. Cars help us to go anywhere we want fast. Without cars, we should walk or run to go to faraway places.\n     Second of all, we use cars a lot. To help you understand better, I would like to give you an example. Many people use public transportation and food delivery. However, these things need cars. Without cars, we should wait hours to get food or to move. Also, many people use cars in free time like enjoying driving. For example, we can get a delivery service in 30 minutes. I think that this is a quite short amount of time. However, without cars, there will no more be delivery service. So, we will be forced to buy foods and products in person. Ii think that this is a quite exhausting work to do.\n     Additionally, cars contributed to our exporting. In Korea, there are many companies that make and sell cars. These jobs play a role in our society because Korea exports many cars. With our technology making cars, we are able to earn a lot of money, and we are known to many countries with our own technology.\n\n     For all these reasons, cars contributed a lot to society and made our lives more convenient and enjoyable. I think we live much more comfortable lives with invention of cars. Also, we will be much more tired and inconvenient without cars. To sum up, I think that cars are the invention that I think have contributed the most to society."},{"wordCount":346,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":158,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":12,"averageWordLength":4.604046242774566,"averageSentenceLength":9.885714285714286,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":21,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                          Great Inventions\n\n     Smartphones are necessary item nowadays. We can't do anything without smartphones. Computer is also very important in our life. Our lives become nicer because of computer. I think that a computer has contributed the most to society. First reason of why computer is helpful is that we can search information. For the second reason, computers are great entertainer. Then, I have an idea for a future invention.\n\n     Firstly, we can search information with computer. We can find great amount of information. According to a research, it shows that world produced 40zb of data last year which is 300 times bigger than that of 2005. It means that numerable data is made and it becomes bigger and bigger. Computer enables us to access these great amount of data easily and fast. We can find information by typing and clicking few times. For example, if I want to find a recipe of meat pie, I could find 347000000 results in 1.12 second at google. Therefore, I think a computer has contributed the most to society.\n     For the second reason, a computer is a great entertainer. We can watch videos, listen to music, play games. We can do anything we want. For example, there are Netflix, Wave, and Disney Plus which provides dramas and movies. Also, we can do SNS. We can share our lives with our friend and communicate when and wherever. We can make new friends. For example of sns platforms, there are Facebook, Instagram and Kakaotalk. \n     Then, I have an idea for a future invention. It is e-textbook which replace the old- fashioned paper book. It is convenient because we don't have to get new books every year. We can just update the machine. It is also good for environment because it reduces paper waste.\n\n     Smartphones have influenced the society a lot. Besides smartphone, I think a computer has contributed the most to society for two reasons. Firstly, we can find great amount of information fast and easily. Secondly, a computer is a great entertainer. Then, my future invention is e-textbook which is convenient and reduce paper waste."},{"wordCount":350,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":127,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":15,"averageWordLength":4.677142857142857,"averageSentenceLength":14.08,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":29,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                       Inventions\n\nThere are so many inventions in our lives. Many inventions changed our lives in many ways. I think the invention which I think that has most contributed the most to society is telephone. My idea for a future invention is animal translator, which is the machine that can translate animals' language.\n\nFirst of all, I want to tell you the reason why I think that the most contributed invention to our society is telephone. A telephone allows us to communicate with people. In the past, people usually communicated with people who are at the far distance with letters. However, letters were difficult for people to always use them. It has so many disadvantages, but with telephones, people can just text message with people at the far distance. It is much convenient than letters.\n     Now, I would like to tell you my idea of future invention. My idea for future invention is the machine that allows people to communicate with animals. These days, people cannot communicate with animals. We cannot understand all of the animal language. With this invention, we can understand animals more. It will allow people to research animals. We cannot understand all of animals nowadays, but if we have this invention, we can know about animals well than now! It can contribute us by developing our technique by this invention. The machine that allows people to communicate with people would change our lives and make better than now. It would be good for both human and animal because if we do not know what animals want, it would be bad for animals which live with people. However, with the machine that allows people to communicate with people will know what animals want from us, and it would give good effects for both humans and animals. This was my idea for future invention, and its purpose.\n\nThis is the reason why I think that telephone is the most contributed invention to our society, and my idea for future invention. I think that invention is very important in our lives. I want people to be convenient in our society with many inventions."},{"wordCount":353,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":186,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":14,"averageWordLength":4.54957507082153,"averageSentenceLength":10.382352941176471,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":18,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":3,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":4,"essayContent":"\n                                                                    Inventions, Develop Human\n\n     Human needs tools to live and evolve. Nowadays, we are living with inventions that were made by ancestors. Some of them are really necessary to us. They change our lives and without them, people can not live. There are many useful inventions. For instance, the smartphone is one of the most useful inventions in the world. Smartphones has completely changed our lives. We can connect people easily and join many information between people. Also, it makes new and various jobs. Just like smartphone, one useful invention can make our lives convenient and affect us in various parts. Not only smartphone, cars are one of the most useful inventions, too.\n\n     Cars have been developed a lot. A long time ago, people usually rode a horse or just walk. However, as the world has been developed rapidly, people began to trade each other. In the process, train and boat were developed. The more time passed, the more people imagines form of cars. First, people made cart and then they wanted carts move itself. People invented cars which could move by wind. After a number of failures, people finally the first gasoline car. That is the car which we are riding today.\n     \n     First, cars allow people move a long distance in a short time. In the past, people could not move far and traveling with horses was not easy way to travel. On the other hand, after inventions of cars, we can travel everywhere we want. Also, we can save much time by riding cars. It takes too much time to walk every time. It allows us to do more things in saved time. Second, there has been created the new jobs about cars. Some people can work hard in company which makes cars. The most popular job about cars today is green car developer. They create cars which are moved by environmental energy such as electricity, water, and grain. As the world becomes polluted, fossil energy is criticized. \n\n     Cars help human to evolve. Cars will keep being developed by human. I hope there are more environmental and effective cars in the future."},{"wordCount":358,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":128,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":24,"averageWordLength":4.681564245810056,"averageSentenceLength":14.916666666666666,"maximumWordLength":12,"maximumSentenceLength":33,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                      Education\n\n     Students learn many things at school. For example, they learn science, math, English, and history. In Korea, students should learn art and music in their elementary, middle, and high school. Some people think all students should learn creative subjects like music and art. However, in my opinion, I believe not all students have to take creative subjects because they are not important as other subjects and people should be talented to do well on creative subjects. \n\n     My first reason is that creative subjects are not as important as other subjects like math or science. Students study hard to get a job. Not many jobs require students to be good at creative subjects like music or art. However, most jobs require students to be good at subjects like math or science. Creative subjects are only important to some students. However, for most students, they don't need to be good at creative subjects. As a result, I think it is a waste of time for those students to learn creative subjects. It would be much beneficial for them to learn other subjects instead of learning creative subjects. \n     Additionally, I think people should be talented to do well on creative subjects. For example, some people are bad at drawing. Even if they learn art, their drawing skill would not improve. Also, learning music might help us to sing better than before, but it would not some people who are bad at singing like me to sing really well. I think people who are good at creative subjects are talented people. Learning creative subjects at school won't help us to do well on those subjects. As a result, I think not all students have to take creative subjects. \n\n     For these two reasons, I strongly believe that not all students should take creative subjects. Learning creative subjects might help, but we can still live a successful life without learning creative subjects. Therefore, I think taking creative subjects are not essential for us. I hope schools don't make all students to take creative subjects, since I think it is a waste of time for students who are bad at those subjects like me."},{"wordCount":354,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":158,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":15,"averageWordLength":5.0141242937853105,"averageSentenceLength":14.16,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":38,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                       Education\n\n     There are a lot of subjects in school classes like Math, English and physical education. Among school subjects, there are creative subjects like music and art. They are not directly related to exams, but some people think that they are necessary because it makes students more creative like their name and  I also agree with the argument that they are necessary for the students. They have a lot of advantages for students not only creativity but also other things.\n\n     To begin with, I'm pretty sure that the creative subjects give some entertainment moments to students. During classes those subjects, students do activities which students can enjoy. And also, students can think freely by doing those activities. Thus, they can enjoy some fun activities at boring and tiring school. I also enjoy those classes during my class time. After my final exam, during my art class and music class, I thought that those classes were very relaxing, but not boring. With my music and art classes, my school life can be much happier and more interesting.\n     For my second argument, I believe that creative subjects make students participate in classes. Since those subjects are usually composed of free activities like drawing or playing instruments. And then, students will enjoy the classes. As a result, they can become more participating students. For example, drawing pictures is comparably more enjoyable than normal classes. It makes students happier so that they can concentrate more on classes after that. Also, for another example, students can make their own music or listen to music. Thus, they will become more satisfied with their class.\n\n     By doing creative activities, children can increase their imagination ability and also be happier. It is related to their well-being. Also, creative subjects can make students relax and ease their tension which was made during normal classes. It is like the heavy rain during big drought. Just by doing creative activities, students can relieve their stress. Therefore, to sum up my opinions, I believe that since creative subjects such as art and music help students to study well, creative subjects are necessary in the school curriculum."},{"wordCount":359,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":174,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":17,"averageWordLength":4.972144846796658,"averageSentenceLength":9.2,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":20,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                              Education\n     \n     Some people believe that students don't have to take creative subjects. It is because they are not essential in studying. However, I believe that all students should take subjects like art, music, and P.E.. The reason is that those subjects can relieve students' stress. They can also help students to acquire various abilities that can be beneficial in life and studying.\n\n     To begin with, subjects such as art, music, and P.E. can ease stress. These days, students are busy with studying and going to academies. They don't have some time to rest and do their own things. The subjects can release academic stress because students don't need to think about their tasks. Since the subjects require student's attention, they can fully focus and enjoy the activities. And some countries increased the time of the subjects to relieve students' stress. For example, 30% of England's curriculum is consist of creative subjects. U.S also has sufficient time for the subjects like art, music, and P.E.. Both countries provide enough time for students to experience multifarious programs and get rid of stress.\n     Additionally, students can grow some abilities by learning art, music, and P.E.. Those subjects have lessons that can't be taught in other academic subjects. In art class, students can learn how to be creative and express their feelings. Furthermore, in P.E. class, students can build up physical strength and learn cooperation, patience, and consideration. In addition a study shows that music class has lots of benefits for students. Students can become sociable while joining the orchestra. Also, appreciating classic music raises concentration thanks to their stable beat and rhythm. These factors can contribute to the efficiency of studying. Thus, art, music, P.E. can help learning important virtues and skills that might be helpful in the future.\n\n     For these reasons, I believe that all students have to take subjects like art, music, and P.E.. Unlike other subjects, art, music, and P.E. don't have one correct answer. They are only affected by the students' effort, so students can enjoy them without burden. Therefore, it is necessary for students to have these kind of education not to limit their creativity and potential power."},{"wordCount":356,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":168,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":12,"averageWordLength":4.609550561797753,"averageSentenceLength":14.28,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":22,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                             Education\n\n     These days, many people are interested in school educations. Some people say that student should take creative subjects such as art and music while the others say don't. However, in my opinion, I believe that students should take creative subjects such as art and music, too. I think this way because we can't ignore creative subjects, and it can help students to find their dream jobs.\n\n     To begin with, we can't ignore creative subjects. Even though academic subjects must be the most important one, creative subjects are still important. For example, P.E is important for student's health. Also, students can't focus well if they have hard classes every time. For example, I once had only academic subjects in one day, and I couldn't focus until the end of the class. I was so tired, and my friends were, too,  I felt that having only hard class isn't effective at all. By having some easy and interesting classes, students who are tired of study can relax. it will also help with student's concentration.\n     Next, having creative classes can help students to find their dream jobs. There are some students who aren't interested at study. However, by making them take creative classes such as art and music, they can probably find out their interest. I want to give an example of my friend's sister. She was frustrated because she didn't know what to do in the future. However, after taking creative class, her mind changed and she even found her interest, and she decided to be a baker. In Korea, middle school 1st graders have some program called free semester system, which is quite similar with creative subjects. I saw many friends finding their job by participating that program, and I think it will be the same with creative classes.  \n\n     These are the reasons why I believe students should take creative subjects such as art and music. We can't ignore its importance, and it also helps students to find their dream jobs. For some people, creative subjects sound unnecessary, but I think it is necessary for students. I think it can help with school's education a lot."},{"wordCount":352,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":145,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":16,"averageWordLength":4.769886363636363,"averageSentenceLength":15.304347826086957,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":31,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":4,"essayContent":"                                                                                    Education\n\n     Some people agree with the statement that all students should take creative subjects such as music and art, but others disagree with this statement because they hinder academic subject studying. These classes might be a burden for some students. However, I agree that all students should take these classes because I believe they make students more intelligent and healthier.\n\n     For the first reason, creative subjects such as art and music make children more intelligent. I believe this to be true because students who are more creative are more intelligent. Subject such as art requires students to think more, and express their opinion. I think this makes students creative, so students will be able to solve problems better with a creative way. To help you understand better, I would like to give you an example of my friend. For instance, I have a friend who is really creative. Recently, she got a perfect score in math. I realized that this score was related to her creativity because her formula was really special and creative.\n     For the second reason, I believe creative subjects make children healthier. Usually, drawing pictures and playing the instrument makes people relieve their stress and feel much more comfortable. So, I think that students who take creative subjects classes will be more enjoyable and have less stress. To help you understand better, I would like to give you my personal example. I used to have a lot of stress. However, when I started my hobby which is coloring pictures, I feel much more relaxed and can spend a lot of time doing this. This hobby was from my art class. So, I think that art and music classes will help many students.\n\n     For all these reasons, Creative subjects such as art and music make student more intelligent, creative, and healthier. Also, these subjects actually do not hinder our studying, but they help our imagination and make us happier. I think that art and music classes are fun and make me proud of me. In this regard, I strongly agree with the statement that all students should take creative subjects."},{"wordCount":354,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":136,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":19,"averageWordLength":4.940677966101695,"averageSentenceLength":13.11111111111111,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":21,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                              Education\n\n     Korea government make all students to take creative subjects. Some people thinks that all student's don't have to take creative subjects, such as music and art in school. However, I disagree. For the first reason, taking creative subjects is helpful for students to find their future jobs. For the second reason, creative subjects makes students' brain develop.\n\n     For the first reason, taking creative subjects is helpful for students to find their future jobs. It is easy to get high score in creative subjects. Then, we can get high total score which is important to go to universities. Also, there are a lot of jobs connected to creative jobs. Especially, nowadays, as art and music is becoming more popular, we can find attractive jobs easily, if we take creative subjects. According to a research, the job which teenagers want the most is creative jobs by 30 percent. As this research shows, creative subjects are in the lime light. Therefore, I think that students should take creative subjects, such as music and art in school. \n     For the second reason, learning creative subjects makes our brain develop. Learning only academic subjects makes our brain tired and exhausted. We should take creative subjects because it develops imagination and creativity. Imagination and creativity is very helpful for students to study. For instance, if our creativity is well developed, we can try new type of math easily. Then, if our imagination is well developed, we can write essays and novels distinctively. In addition, creative subjects are very unique. By learning new things and experience, we could have more opened-mind. It is very significant because we meet a lot of new people while living and the society is changing very quickly. Thus, I think that all students should take creative subjects, such as art and music in school. \n\n     In conclusion, I believe that all students should take creative subjects, such as music and art in school. For the first reason, taking creative subjects is helpful for students to find their future jobs. For the second reason, creative subject makes students' brain develop.

Some people agree with the statement. However, other people disagree with this statement. I believe that all students should take creative subjects, such as music and art, in school because of these two following reasons.\n\n     The first reason why I agree with this statement is that creative subjects like music and art, especially art is in our lives. For example, for art, when we interior our houses, we need art skills to interior them. We should choose the color of the room, and put furniture in the room. If you do not have these art skills, you cannot do these things effectively. For the second example, there is part of music in our lives. We can see opera or musical, and most commonly, we can listen to the music we want. If we do not learn about music in school, we are not able to know about the music accurately. Therefore, I believe that all students should take creative subjects, such as music and art, in school.\n     The second reason why agree with the statement is that some jobs include these creative skills. For example, there is an artist, and designer. Both of them is a lot of people's job in our society. However, if we do not teach these creative skills such as music and art, they do not have an opportunity to find their talent in creative subjects such as music and art. Also, there is a singer. Singer is a job which include a creative skill, music. However, students cannot find their interest in music if the school does not teach the music subject. Therefore, I believe that all students should take creative subjects, such as music and art in school.\n\n     These are the two reasons why I believe that all students take creative subjects, such as music and art, in school. I think we need creative subjects, such as music and art to live in our society. They take big place in our lives, so I think they should be taught in our schools."},{"wordCount":362,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":152,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":21,"averageWordLength":5.0220994475138125,"averageSentenceLength":12.482758620689655,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":21,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                                         Importance of subjects\n\n     At school, students gain knowledge by following the set of curriculum. In curriculum, many subjects' classes are decided for students. Students must learn a lots of subjects, including art, music, math, and English. Some students complain about learning creative subjects instead of studying subjects. Then, the country says learning many subjects are helpful and necessary for students. However, I do not believe all students should take creative subjects at school. First, some students may hate learning creative subjects. Second, learning creative subjects can be the time waste for some students. \n\n     To begin, some students may hate learning creative subjects. For most people, liking the subject which they are talented in is natural. However, only few students are talented in creative subjects. Others might be hard to learn those subjects. Difficulty to learn things can become hatred about them. That is because many students feel hatred about art and music. For instance, I am not talented in music. When the music class starts, I always feel extremely tired and bored. Also, the classes are too hard to me to understand correctly. Sometimes, I get lots of stress about creative subjects because it is too hard to learn. Then, I ca not concentrate in studying too.\n\n     Next, learning creative subjects can be the time waste for some student. As some students are talented in creative subjects, others are talented in studying. For those students, learning creative subjects can decrease the time which they can improve their own potential. So, taking other subjects' classes can be much more helpful for them than taking boring creative subjects' classes. Also, for the high school students, creative subjects can be harmful to concentrate in studying. For example, my brother who is in the high school, get less scores in math because he must finish music report. \n\n     In conclusion, I believe all students must not take classes about creative subjects at school. Of course, learning many subjects is good for students. However, I think all schools should do their best to find out students' dreams and help them to achieve their dreams. To sum up, schools should give students to choose their classes, not forcing them."},{"wordCount":392,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":150,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":43,"averageWordLength":3.913265306122449,"averageSentenceLength":13.517241379310345,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":37,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                            Early Childhood Development\n\n     Children get many presents like toys or cameras when they are young. These presents can not only make children feel happy but also help children mature. For example, sports equipment can help children to be healthier. Among many presents which can help a kid mature, I believe a pet dog can help a child develop because it can help a child to learn responsibility and it can also help a child to exercise. \n\n     First, taking care of a dog can help a child to learn responsibility. There are many things to do while taking care of a dog. For instance, a dog needs feeding, and grooming and it can get sick if it is not taken care of. By taking care of a pet, a child can learn responsibility. For example, I raise a dog. I should take care of my dog. I should feed my dog on time. That was my duty. After taking care of a dog, I became more responsible for the things that I should do. \n     Additionally, raising a dog can help a child no to feel lonely and feel a sense of stability. Nowadays, many parents have to work, so a child should stay home alone for a long time. Therefore, a child might feel lonely or bored. When a child is with a dog, he can play with a dog, so he won't feel lonely. A child and a dog can be a good friend to each other. Also, when you raise a dog, a hormone that makes you feel good is secreted. When you feel down, a dog can make you feel better. \n     Finally, a dog can teach a child how to manage time. A dog needs a lot of attention. A child needs to feed and walk his dog regularly. Also, walking with a dog can improve your health. Raising a dog can also improve immune system. As a result, taking care of a dog helps a child to live a regular and healthy life. \n\n     For these three reasons, I believe that giving a pet dog can help a child to develop. I think taking care of a dog can help a child in many ways. There are many other presents which can help a child develop, but I think taking care of a pet can help a child the most."},{"wordCount":350,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":159,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":19,"averageWordLength":4.0285714285714285,"averageSentenceLength":15.217391304347826,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":39,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                              Special Childhood Present\n     For children, environment is very important for their mature. And also, some objects can help them growing. They also have good effects for children such as good memories, and new hobbies. For example, they could be bikes, books, instruments or a pet. From now, I want to tell you about what special gift would I give to my child later.\n\n     To begin with, I strongly believe that a digital camera will be a perfect gift for my child. It is true that a camera is fragile and little bit expensive. However, I think a digital camera will help the child to observe things around him or her, and then he or she will be able to feel the beauty of landscapes, some objects, and people near him or her. It is the best way to understand nearby environment. And for other benefit that I would get by giving my child a camera is that it will be the topic of chat I make with my child. As my child grows, I will grow too. Thus, later, there will be less topic to talk to my child. However, if I give my child a digital camera, I can talk about our same hobby, photograph.\n     When I was young, I was given a two wheel bike by my parents. I think it played a very important role in my life. To be taught, I played a lot with my dad. And also, when I started to ride bikes, it became my new favorite hobby, and also I like riding bikes nowadays, too. A bike also help me to increase my strength. \n\n     A object can even affect significantly to children's life. As I did, I think a camera will help my child a lot. I am pretty sure that it will help my child to understand about things around him or her and to share same interest with me. Like this, the object which children get play a very significant role in children's life. Thus, I believe that a digital camera is the perfect gift to help children to develop."},{"wordCount":366,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":177,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":17,"averageWordLength":4.898907103825136,"averageSentenceLength":13.555555555555555,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":26,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                               Early Childhood Development\n\n     There are many presents that can help children to be mature. But I think that a Lego can be the perfect option to help children's development. A Lego is a kind of toy that has various sizes of bricks. Children can make anything using these bricks. It is the best gift to make children mature because it helps them to have calm and stable mind. It is also beneficial for children to train their brain and hands.\n\n     The first reason is that a Lego can provide mature mind and offer lots of cognitive ability. Children are able to learn patience while building a Lego. During the building process, they can recognize that achievement needs a lot of effort and time. And when they complete making a Lego, they can feel satisfied and improve their self-confidence. They can learn concentration too, because it needs plenty of attention to make things with a Lego. In addition, a Lego is the most efficient tool for children to experience teamwork. They can become sociable and cooperative towards people. Children talk to each other and find solution when they face the difficulty. Thus, building a Lego can develop conversation skills too. \n     Moreover, making a Lego can make children to improve their brain and physical abilities. Children follow the instruction and find out the location and patterns of the particular brick. This way, they can think and see object in three dimensions which grow children's space perception ability. Children can also advance their imagination and creativity. Children can make things with surplus bricks, but without any instruction. Additionally, touching a Lego can develop small muscles of their hands. Finger force and dexterity are influenced positively by touching a Lego. Therefore, since a Lego is capable for training both brain and hands, it is a helpful present that makes children to educate themselves in enjoyable ways.\n\n     For these reasons, I think that a Lego can be the most beneficial present for children to enhance their mind, brain, and hands. Patience, concentration, social skills, brain ability, and development of hands. These things are all essential when we became older. A Lego can make children learn various skills and make them mature."},{"wordCount":351,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":164,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":13,"averageWordLength":4.378917378917379,"averageSentenceLength":15.954545454545455,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":28,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                          Early Childhood Development\n\n     A good present can help a kid mature. If I have to give present to a kid, I would give that kid a book to assist his or her development. I think this way because kids can learn lots of things from books, and reading is important for their life. \n\n     To begin with, kids can learn lots for things form books, because in books, there are lots of stories and information. Also, some books are about a life of one famous person, which is called biography, and it can inspire kids in positive ways. Also, by reading books, they can develop their lexical ability. They will be able to learn hard expressions in novel, and they can learn hard words from non-fiction books. It will help a lot when they grow up, because sometimes, ability to use proper words is important. Books can be a friend for them, too. When they are bored or depressed, they can read books and relax. I want to give an example of my friend. She didn't like studying, so she couldn't get good score on tests. However, after she read one book, she got inspiration, and she started to study harder. \n     My next argument is that reading is important for kids' life. Sometimes, in tests, it require students to read passage and find answers. However, the reading passage is so hard that some students can't even finish reading all the passages till the end of the test. However, by reading books from young age, they can prepare for hard tests. Also, many workers in eminent companies have ability to read documents fast. Reading books can also help them in this situation. Some people have difficulty reading long passages, but people who've read many books have ability of rapid reading. \n\n     To sum up, I would give books to children because children can learn lots of things from books, and reading can develop necessary skills when they grow up. There must be many good presents for kids, something like pets or cameras, but I think books are the best present for lots of kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"wordCount":352,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":160,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":17,"averageWordLength":4.326704545454546,"averageSentenceLength":16.761904761904763,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":26,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":5,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                           Perfect Gift for an Early Childhood Development\n\n     There are many kinds of presents around the world, and some kinds of gift can help my kid mature. The gift that I received and helped in my childhood is my smartphone. It is a machine that helped me search information and contact with my friends. However, I would like to give my kid a pet like an animal or a plant. I believe that the pet will help my kid mature. There are some reasons for my gift.\n\n     The first reason is that a pet and plant will help my child to learn responsibility. I think this because animals and plants are living creatures like us. Additionally, I think caring and living with another creatures will teach my child spirit of independence because pets require more care. Furthermore, when pets are sick, the child will learn sympathy and try to cure them. Overall, I believe raising a pet will make the child more flexible in life.\n     The second reason is that living with a pet is good for our mental and physical health. According to a doctor in United States, \"Boris Levinson\", pets play an important role in children's cognitive development, and improve self-esteem. Also, stroking an animal like dogs and cats relieves stress and causes endorphin, which means happiness. Also, adopting a cat or dog lowers blood pressure, and this is better than taking a medicine. People who have pets exercise more than 54 percent comparing to the average ones. Overall, living and caring pets will be good for my kid and me in physical and mental health.\n\n     For all these reasons, pets help children to develop mental, physical health, and they will make my child mature. So, I believe that a pet will be the perfect present for my kid to mature. I am not trying to call a pet gift, but providing my kid a chance to care pets and learn many things will be great. In this regard, If I give my kid a present to help them grow, I would like to give a pet to help my kid mature."},{"wordCount":351,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":136,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":23,"averageWordLength":4.387464387464387,"averageSentenceLength":13,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":28,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                               Early Childhood Development\n\n     When I was a child, my mother gave me a soccer ball. It made me good at soccer and helped me to make many new friends and be famous in school. If I can give a gift to help a child to develop, I would give him a rope which is used while jumping rope. For the first reason, exercise helps us to keep healthy. For the second reason, jumping is good for growing.\n\n     For the first reason, exercise helps us to keep healthy. Jumping rope is great cardio exercise. It helps our cardiovascular organs which including heart to keep healthy and work well. Also, jumping rope needs a great amount of power of legs. It hugely develops our muscles. For example, the first lesson of boxing is always jumping rope. Even professional boxers do jumping rope everyday because jumping rope increase the balance of our body and power of leg which makes us to stand against the punches. Therefore, if I could give a gift to help a child to develop, I would give a jumping rope.\n     For the second reason, jumping is good for growing. Child is the age which needs to grow constantly. They have to eat and sleep well. However, exercising to stimulate the growth plate is as important as eating and sleeping. Then, the jumping rope is the most suitable exercise to stimulate growth plate. Because, It makes us to keep jumping which is the best way to stimulate growth plate. For instance, at elementary school, every freshmen have to do jumping rope until they grow enough. It means that school agrees that jumping rope is ideal exercise to grow. Thus, If i can, I would give a jumping rope to a child to develop.\n\n     In conclusion, I would give a jumping rope to help a child to develop. For the first reason, exercise helps us to keep healthy. Jumping rope is both good at cardio exercise and strengthen muscles. For the second reason, jumping is good for growing. It is true that jumping rope is ideal exercise to stimulate the growth plate."},{"wordCount":360,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":123,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":22,"averageWordLength":3.9444444444444446,"averageSentenceLength":12.857142857142858,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":27,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                     Early Childhood Development\n\n     A present can help a child to be mature. I think the best gift to make a child mature is pet. I think a pet can help a children to develop many skills. I would like to explain why a pet can make a child mature.\n\n     A pet can help children to be mature. Firstly, a pet helps a child to grow his or her responsibility. They should take care of their pets when they got a present, pet. They have many things to do. They should feed them, wash them, and play with them. It is hard for a child to learn a responsibility in book. However, taking care of their own pets would make them easier to learn responsibility, because they should do many things for them to live with their pets. It would be very helpful for them to grow their responsibility. Secondly, they can learn to be close with others. Some children have difficulty being close with others. However, when they have their pets, they commune with their pets. It would make them easier to be intimate with others. It would give good effects for their relationship! Therefore, I believe that a pet can make a child mature the best.\n     I think the gift I received in my childhood helped me the most is a pet, as I said. I got a cat from my parents at my birthday, when I was 11 years old. By taking care of my pet, I could grow my responsibility. It also gave me a lot of good effects, too. I could be intimate with my cat, so I could feel rested when I play with my cat. I like animals, so I felt very happy to be with my own pet. The most good effect was that I did not feel bored, and I could grow my responsibility.\n\n     This was about an explanation why a pet can make a child mature. I think it is a best way to give a child a pet to make them developed. They should have responsibility of their pets, so it would be very helpful for them to grow a pet."},{"wordCount":353,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":174,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":18,"averageWordLength":4.923512747875354,"averageSentenceLength":12.607142857142858,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":22,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                                        Children Present\n\n     Giving presents on special day, such as birthday is common culture in the world. Presents make people feel happy. There must not be the person who does not want to get present. However, the recipient could feel bad if he get a gift that is too wrong. Therefore, people should be careful at choosing one's present. In some cases, not only present makes people feel happy but also it can be helpful to people. For example, some presents might be important to children. When preparing children's present, people become much more careful. People usually buy toy cars, dolls, books, and clothes for children.\n\n     There are a lot of children presents, however, I believe puzzles are the most helpful present for children. If I had to prepare child's present, I would necessarily buy puzzles. Puzzle is very helpful to children in many ways. First, puzzle can make children's concentration increase. Children should be focus on puzzling a lot. Next, finishing puzzles can give children a high sense of accomplishment. As puzzle is hard to finish, when children complete puzzle, they can get sense of accomplishment. Children want to achieve more things by completing puzzle. \n\n     The other reason why I think puzzle is the most helpful present is it can improve children's studying abilities. A difficult puzzle is hard to complete, so children should use their head a lot to solve it. Also, some puzzles are made to increase children's thinking ability. The more brain rotation, the smarter a child will be. Also, puzzles can develop children's vision and perception. When you look at a child who is good at puzzles is really different. In addition, it increases eye and hand coordination and the ability to know spatial location, spatial relationships.\n\n     To conclude, for these many reasons, I think puzzles are the most helpful presents for children. It is important to increase many abilities for children in childhood. Puzzles give children creativity, a high sense of accomplishment, and studying abilities too. Completing puzzles can be the best education to children, so many people especially mothers often buy puzzles for their children nowadays too."},{"wordCount":368,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":147,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":28,"averageWordLength":4.603260869565218,"averageSentenceLength":14.153846153846153,"maximumWordLength":14,"maximumSentenceLength":26,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                      Sociology\n\n     We meet many new people while living and the First Impression is determined when we first see the person. Some people believe that the First Impression is the best way to judge an individual's character. They think the First Impression can tell us many things about the person. However, it is my opinion that the First Impression is not the best way to judge an individual;s character. \n\n     Firstly, we cannot know many things about the person by the First Impression. The person might not show his real personality at the first time. If we judge a person's character by the First Impression, we might make a wrong judgement. For example, I met my friend at the math academy. At first, I thought she was very quite person since she didn't talk a lot during the class. However, as I became closer to her, I found out that she was actually talkative. She just didn't talk so much in the math academy. Like this, a person can hide their real characteristic at the first time. \n     Additionally, I believe the First Impression is not correct. The First Impression is determined in a short period of time. Therefore, there must be some parts that we cannot know in a short time. However, if we judge an individual's character after knowing each other for long time, we can make more precise judgement than judging by the First Impression. \n     Finally, I think the First Impression is determined by many factors. I think surrounding environment can also affect the First Impression. As a result, judgement by the First Impression is not accurate. For example, weather can influence the First Impression. If we meet a person in sunny day, the First Impression of the person is likely to be positive. Also, if we meet a person when we are not feeling good, the First Impression of that person would likely to be negative. \n\n     For these three reasons. I strongly believe that the First Impression is not the best way to judge an individual's character. The First Impression may help to judge an individual's character, but it is not always accurate. I think judging individual's character by the First Impression can lead to wrong judgement."},{"wordCount":351,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":139,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":4.717948717948718,"averageSentenceLength":18.473684210526315,"maximumWordLength":16,"maximumSentenceLength":31,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                            The First Impression\n     The first impression is made when a person contacts another the first time. Most people use the first impression to judge a people. Some say that judging an individual with his or her first impression is the most effective way to judge people, because they think that it is a easy and accurate way. However, I believe that judging a person with his or her first impression is wrong.\n\n     To begin with, I am sure that people cannot know the real personality with the first impression. A lot of factors which are changed every day can affect significantly to an individual's first impression. For instance, if a person is tired, most people that contact with the person must say that the person is a lethargic person. So, not in a true conditions, the first impression of an individual must lead to misunderstanding of him or her. Also, a person can easily make fake first impression by showing other people especially different attitude from his or her real personality. This means that just a temporary image making can easily make a good image if people use first impression to judge people.\n     For my second point, I want to say that appearance is often used to make an individual's first impression. A lot of people express an individual by saying about his or her appearance. Those people explain an individual's first impression with words such as pretty or handsome. Judging people with their appearance is not only rude but also wrong way to judge people. Handsome people are often considered as kind people, and some people with little scary-looking face are often considered as people who fight with others. Thus, I think judging with appearance also leads to a lot of misunderstanding.\n\n     The first impression is definitely the most impressive memory of an individual. But, judging people with an individual's first impression is wrong because it can lead to a lot of problems and misunderstanding of people. Thus, to sum up my opinion, I believe that judging people with an individual's first impression is a wrong way to judge people."},{"wordCount":358,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":174,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":14,"averageWordLength":5.128491620111732,"averageSentenceLength":14.32,"maximumWordLength":16,"maximumSentenceLength":24,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                                           Sociology\n\n     Some people believe that the first impression of an individual is the best way to judge an individual because all people have intuition. However, in my opinion, I believe that the first impression is not the appropriate way to evaluate an individuals's character. It is because we can make incorrect evaluation when we judge people from appearance. Also, our judgment can differ from situation.\n\n     To begin with, appearance doesn't tell the entire thing about an individual. People need long time to understand others deeply. The first impression doesn't take enough time that is required for judging people. It is because the judgement is made only in one minutes not considering carefully about them. It is just our assumption when we evaluate people from the first impression without talking and spending time with them. Since we don't know their personalities and environments, our judgement is not always accurate. Inaccurate judgement can bring misunderstanding between people. Also, many people are able to hide themselves, not showing their real characters. For example, many criminals have normal and kind appearance. Thus, judging from people's appearance is often incorrect.\n     Additionally, our evaluation differs from various situation. Many factors such as our emotions, place, and conditions can affect our judgement. For instance, when we are in a good mood, we may recognize an individual positively. In contrast, when we feel bad, we may recognize an individual negatively even though the individual did nothing wrong. And if we don't perceive that this way of judging people isn't right, our recognition can last for a long time. It can make us fall into a bias and see people only in positive or negative way nevertheless they are not. Therefore, because the evaluation from the first impression is affected by various factors, the result is not trustful.\n\n     For these reasons, I believe that the first impression of an individual is not the best method to judge individual's character. Our assumption from the appearance has limits and it is occasionally wrong. Our judgement is influenced by lots of elements too. We shouldn't judge people from their first impression since their first impression don't connote everything about people."},{"wordCount":374,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":132,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":14,"averageWordLength":4.446524064171123,"averageSentenceLength":19.68421052631579,"maximumWordLength":13,"maximumSentenceLength":41,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                       Sociology\n\n     These days, many people believe that first impression of an individual is important because they think it is the best way to judge an individual's character. However, in my opinion, I think first impression is not the best way to judge an individual's character because it is too short time to judge one person, and some people don't reveal their real personality when they meet fist time.\n\n     To begin with, first impression is too short time to judge one person. Almost every person judge people with appearance when they meet someone for the first time. However, it isn't careful analysis because not every people act just like their appearance. To give an example, if I meet one man who looks scary, I can't just conclude him to be a scary person, because I don't know that much about him, and appearance doesn't tell everything about that person. Also, if someone act not politely in first meeting, people easily judge that person to be rude. However, it is also too hasty decision because maybe that person was sick or tired that day. I think we can fully understand one person only when we see him or her for a long time.\n     My second argument is that some people don't reveal their real personality when they meet one person first time. For example, if one girl is shy, then that girl can't talk well when she meet one person for the fist time. So person who meet her can judge her to be shy and quite girl. However, if they meet second time, the girl can open her mind and can act more lively and friendly. Like this, we can't judge one people's character on the first encounter. Also, if the situation of the first meeting is uncomfortable, some person can't adapt, and they don't reveal their real feelings or character. I also think that atmosphere of one place can change one person's fist impression, so first impression is unreliable.\n\n     To sum up, it is too short time to judge one person and some people don't reveal their real personality when they meet first time.

However, in my perspective, I believe that first impression is not the greatest way to identify ones' personality. The first reason is that first impression does not mean every people's personality. The second reason is that I think first impression is just a prejudice.\n\n     The first reason is that personality is not related to first impression. I believe this to be true because first impression does not always mean character. First impression is only related to appearance, which is not always the same. Some people differ in their appearance and character. To help you understand better, I would like to give an example of some criminals. Many people think of criminals of a scary image, but some criminals do not look like that way, so people think that they are good people. Overall, this means that first impression is not related to people's personality.\n     The second reason is that first impression is just a prejudice. I think this because it is actually not proved to be true. First impression, which is superficial effect, just judges others within a second, and the brain mistakenly identifies the opponent in 0.3 seconds. However, it is impossible to identify a person's personality within a second by external factors. This means that first impression is just our brain's delusion. For my personal instance, I have met a friend who was always expressionless and had a first impression that everyone was unhappy with. I thought she was unlikable, but after talking to her a few times, she was a really good friend. From this, overall, I learned that it is wrong to judge people with first impression.\n\n     For all these reasons, I believe that first impression is not exactly proved, and just a delusion. To conclude, I strongly believe that first impression is not a best method to judge other people's personality."},{"wordCount":355,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":128,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":20,"averageWordLength":4.92112676056338,"averageSentenceLength":14.2,"maximumWordLength":12,"maximumSentenceLength":22,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                      First impression\n\n     Many people says that first impression can't be changed and it's very important to make relationship with others. However, in my opinion, first impression of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character. For the first reason, appearance of an individual is a very small part of an individual. For the second reason, first impression is very subjective because of intuition.\n\n     For the first reason, appearance of an individual is a very small part of an individual. Appearance doesn't decide individual's personality. Appearance is the only thing that we can't change with effort. Mind and values of an individual is much more important than first impression of appearance. Also, when person  first meet, we often get nervous and awkward. The true personality of an individual can't be shown. We should evaluate people after we be closer. For example, some people be silent and behave when they meet someone new. However, their original personality can be very talkative and playful. Therefore, first impression of an individual is a very small part of an individual. \n     For the second reason, first impression is very subjective. First impression is judged by intuition of one and intuition is very uncertain and personal idea. Also, prejudice hinder relationship. When people make prejudice, they easily be affected by their feeling in spite of themselves. For example, when we meet friends, sometimes we get angry with their prank, while we sometimes are fun with prank of friend. Like this, wee shouldn't evaluate people with just first impression because it is very subjective and greatly affected by feeling. Thus, I think that first impression of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character. \n\n     In conclusion, I think that first impression of an individual in not the best way to judge an individual's character. For the first reason, appearance of an individual is a very small part of an individual. For the second reason reason, first impression is very subjective because of an intuition. I believe that we should always try to watch good part of someone, then others will watch our good parts either."},{"wordCount":353,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":110,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":17,"averageWordLength":4.739376770538244,"averageSentenceLength":17.65,"maximumWordLength":11,"maximumSentenceLength":33,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":4,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":4,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"                                                                                    First Impression\n\n     Some people believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is the best way to judge an individual's character. However, others believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character. I believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character because of these two following reasons.\n\n    The first reason I believe this way is that an individual's appearance usually chooses the first impression. However, people do not behave how they look. An appearance of an individual does not have connection with his or her personality and character. I believe that they are usually incorrect because first impression has connection with an appearance.. For example, some people could think that a person with short hair is man. However, they could be an woman, too. Therefore, I believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character.\n     The second reason why I believe this way is that I think it is more correct to judge people's character after spending time with them. Only with a first impression, we cannot judge one's personality and character correctly, or it is usually hard to judge them without spending time, because we do not have much information of them. However, if people spend time with them, it would be more correct, and accurate to judge their personality and character, because we can know each other when we spend time together. It is much more accurate than just judging them with their first impression. For example, I would think someone looks like outgoing, but since I spend time with her, she could not be outgoing. It could be incorrect. Therefore, I believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character.\n\n     These are the two reasons why I believe that the \"First Impression\" of an individual is not the best way to judge an individual's character. I think first impression is not that important at all. It could not be an individual's real character."},{"wordCount":407,"level":10,"numberOfSpellingErrors":0,"numberOfUniqueWordsUsed":180,"maximumTimesAWordIsRepeated":15,"averageWordLength":4.783783783783784,"averageSentenceLength":11.970588235294118,"maximumWordLength":15,"maximumSentenceLength":18,"contentGrade":5,"fluencyGrade":5,"grammarGrade":4,"vocabularyGrade":5,"conventionsGrade":5,"essayContent":"\n                                                      The First Meeting with People\n\n     Almost every people makes up themselves to be pretty or handsome. They paint their faces, buy fashionable clothes and luxury goods. The reason why they are so obsessed with decorating themselves is because of lookism. Lookism is judging people by their facial features. It could sound like good meaning word, however it is not. People sometimes discriminate other people who are not pretty due to lookism. Lookism usually happens in first time meeting between people. It affects a lot the first impression so people are obsessed with their appearance. People do not want to be ignored because of their appearance. I believe this phenomenon should be disappear, because the first impression does not really relevant with one's character.\n\n     To begin with my first reason, commonly, the first impression is highly depended on one's appearance. Like I said earlier, people think appearance can represent people's character. However, without some cases, there is not any relevant between appearance and character. We must not think a pretty person is always kind and ugly person is always bad tempered. It is one of the discriminations people usually do. Without character, grades and properties are irrelevant whether they are handsome or not. \n\n     Next reason is the first impression is not one's everything. People usually judge others by not only appearance but some tiny actions too. The fact that first impression affects relationship has been proved already. This means people think the first impression is really important and want to be nice to others. There are some reasons that the first impression can not represent one's character. First, normally at first meeting with people, every people are nervous. When people nervous it is normal to do mistakes. Due to those tiny mistakes we should not judge they are people's character. Second, one's charm is supposed to find out later. As you know someone deeper, you can find his real character in lots of experience with him. You can not know it by first time. \n\n     For these reasons, I believe the first impression does not really relevant with one's character. Although I argue like this, even I judge people by their first impression. Whenever I do this, I try to not judge them at first. I try to find their real charms and know them more. I know it is a really hard job. Sometimes I can not do like this. However, I hope people to do like me!"}]
